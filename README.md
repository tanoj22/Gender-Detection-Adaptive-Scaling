# Gender-Detection-Adaptive-Scaling
This project experiments with Fair Adaptive Scaling (FAS), a method that re-weights training samples to address disparities in underperforming classes or groups. By combining individual difficulty and group-level scaling, FAS improves both accuracy and fairness in model performance.
